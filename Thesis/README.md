# TLS-malware-detection-with-AI

My undergraduate diploma thesis for Computer Engineering and Informatics Department of University of Patras is: Artificial Intelligence algorithms to detect malware in TLS traffic.


# Abstract

The goal of this diploma thesis is the application of artificial intelligence algorithms, which detect malware in the traffic of TLS protocol. The TLS protocol is the one used extensively for client and server communication over the Web. It provides packet encryption in order to protect messages, transactions and other activities. The novelty of this work is that the packages are not decrypted to check if they contain malware, but artificial intelligence algorithms are trained, based on features, certificates and metadata we choose, to predict with great accuracy whether it is malware or not. As a result, we do not violate users' personal data, such as passwords, since packets are not decrypted and we also minimize delays in the communication of client and server, which would not happen if we decrypted each packet separately.
